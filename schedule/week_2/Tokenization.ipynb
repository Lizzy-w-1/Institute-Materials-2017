    "Tokenization (the first of the five parts of the [Gothenburg model](http://wiki.tei-c.org/index.php/Textual_Variance#The_.E2.80.9CGothenburg_model.E2.80.9D:_A_modular_architecture_for_computer-aided_collation)) divides the texts to be collated into *tokens*, which are most commonly (but not obligatorily) words. By default CollateX considers punctuation to be its own token, which means that the witness readings “Hi!” and “Hi” will both contain a token that reads “Hi” (and the first witness will contain an additional token, which reads “!”). In this situation, that’s the behavior the user probably wants, since both witnesses contain what a human would recognize as the same word.\n",

If the default tokenization does what you need, so much the better, but if not, you can override it according to your own requirements. Below we describe what CollateX does by default and how to override that behavior and perform your own tokenization.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How CollateX tokenizes: default behavior\n",
    "The default tokenizer built into CollateX defines a token as a string of either alphanumeric characters (in any writing system) or non-alphanumeric characters, in both cases including any (optional) trailing whitespace. This means that the input reading “Peter’s cat.” will be analyzed as consisting of five tokens: “Peter” plus “’” plus “s ” plus “cat” plus “.”. For alignment purposes CollateX ignores any trailing white space, so that “cat” in “The cat in the hat” would be tokenzied as “cat ” (with a trailing space), but for collation purposes it would match the “cat” in “Peter’s cat.”, which has no trailing space because it’s followed by a period.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we need to override the default tokenization behavior, we can create our own tokenized input and tell CollateX to use that, instead of letting CollateX perform the tokenization itself prior to collation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Doing your own tokenization\n",
    "In a way that is consistent with the modular design of the Gothenburg model, CollateX permits the user to change the tokenization without having to change the other parts of the collation process. Since the tokenizer passes to CollateX the indivisible units that are to be aligned, performing our own collation means specifying those units on our own. We will now look at how we can split a text into tokens the way we prefer."

    "## Automating the tokenization\n",
    "In the example above we built our token list by hand, but that obviously isn’t scalable to a real project with more than a handful of words. Let’s enhance the code above so that it builds the token lists for us by tokenizing the input strings according to our requirements. This is where projects have to identify and formalize their own specifications, since, unfortunately, there is no direct way to tell Python to read your mind and “keep punctuation with adjacent letters when I want it there, but not when I don’t.” For this example, we’ll write a tokenizer that breaks a string first on white space (which would give us two tokens: “Peter’s” and “cat.”) and then, within those intermediate tokens, on *final* punctuation (separating the final period from “cat” but not breaking on the internal apostrophe in “Peter’s”). This strategy would also keep English-language contractions together as single tokens, but as we’ve written it, it wouldn’t separate a leading quotation mark from a word token, although that’s a behavior we’d probably want. In Real Life we might fine-tune the routine still further, but for this tutorial we’ll prioritize just handling the sample data.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Specifying the witnesses to be used in the collation\n",
    "The format in which CollateX expects to receive our custom lists of tokens for all witnesses to be collated is a [**Python dictionary**](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html?#dictionaries), which has the following structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "    { \"witnesses\": [ witness_a, witness_b ] }\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a Python dictionary whose **key** is the word `witnesses`, and whose **value** is a list of the witnesses (that is, the sets of text tokens) that we want to collate. Doing our own tokenization, then, means building a dictionary like the one above and putting our custom tokens in the correct format where the `witness_a` and `witness_b` variables stand above.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Specifying the siglum and token list for each witness\n",
    "The witness data for each witness is a Python dictionary that must contain two properties, which have as keys the strings `id` and `tokens`. The value for the `id` key is a string that will be used as the siglum of the witness in any CollateX output. The value for the `tokens` key is a Python list of tokens that comprise the text (much like what we have made with our regular expressions, but we have one more step to get through...!\n",
    "\n",
    "    witness_a = { \"id\": \"A\", \"tokens\": list_of_tokens_for_witness_a }\n",
    "\n",
    "### Specifying the tokens for each witness\n",
    "Each token for each witness is a Python dictionary with at least one member, which has the key \"t\" (think “text”). You'll learn in the Normalization unit what else you can put in here. A token for the string “cat” would look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "    { \"t\": \"cat\" }\n",
    "\n",
    "The key for every token is the string \"t\"; the value for this token is the string \"cat\". As noted above, the tokens for a witness are structured as a Python list, so if we chose to split our text only on whitespace we would tokenize our first witness as:\n",
    "\n",
    "    list_of_tokens_for_witness_a = [ { \"t\": \"Peter's\" }, { \"t\": \"cat.\" } ]\n",
    "\n",
    "Our witness has two tokens, instead of the five that the default tokenizer would have provided, because we’ve done the tokenization ourselves according to our own specifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Putting it all together\n",
    "For ease of exposition we’ve used variables to limit the amount of code we write in any one line. We define our sets of tokens as:\n",
    "\n",
    "    list_of_tokens_for_witness_a = [ { \"t\": \"Peter's\" }, { \"t\": \"cat.\" } ]\n",
    "    list_of_tokens_for_witness_b = [ { \"t\": \"Peter's\" }, { \"t\": \"dog.\" } ]\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have those, we can define our witnesses that bear these tokens:\n",
    "\n",
    "    witness_a = { \"id\": \"A\", \"tokens\": list_of_tokens_for_witness_a }\n",
    "    witness_b = { \"id\": \"B\", \"tokens\": list_of_tokens_for_witness_b }\n",
    "\n",
    "until finally we define our collation set as:\n",
    "\n",
    "    { \"witnesses\": [ witness_a, witness_b ] }\n",
    "\n",
    "with variables that point to the data for the two witnesses. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is also possible to represent the same information directly, without variables:\n",
    "\n",

EMED documentary editions mark the line breaks as they appear in the print witness, but it is understood that other projects may wish to format the text differently. Therefore, the text itself is not enclosed in any kind of line tag. Instead, the elements of a typographic line are combined using a <gi>milestone</gi> tag. Using <gi>milestone</gi> tags allows us to maintain the lines as they are in print witness while providing flexibility. Not insignificantly, this also helps to avoid overlapping hierarchies in the XML.</p>\n",

Turnunders and turnovers continue the previous line in the space above or below it, and therefore inherit the line number of the line they complete. Turnunders, turnovers, and indented short lines that continue the previous metrical line are sometimes printed with a preceding bracket: these are transcribed by EMED as a <gi>metamark</gi>.</p>\n",
      "                    <p>When specifying <att>who</att> attributes, we adopt aspects of the Folger Digital Text's character referencing system to deal with the known and the ambiguous. Who attributes for clearly identified speakers are composed of their mixed case name followed by the playcode. Thus, Barabas is Barabas_JoM, Tamburlaine is Tamburlaine_1Tam in Tamburlaine Part One and Tamburlaine_2Tam in Part Two, and the Citizen's wife in London Prodigal is CitizensWife_LonPro. Characters who do not have names may be identified in relation to a group of characters, expressed in capital letters. There is an attempt to develop a controlled vocabulary, so Mariners are SAILORS, Keepers are JAILERS, and Captains may be SOLDIERS. ATTENDANTS is a catch-all category that can include Lords, Gentlemen, Torchbearers, Servants, and others. If the attendant is identified as female, the catch-all term is MAIDS. A decimal-based system allows the addition of more information. Zabina's maid Ebea is MAIDS.ZABINA.Ebea_1Tam. Another maid in her retinue could be designated MAIDS.ZABINA.1_1Tam. These still refer to individual characters. For an unnamed character who is nonetheless a single, trackable individual we can use a group term followed by .1, .2 and so on. If it is not clear whether this is the same individual as someone who has appeared previously, we would use the group name followed by .X. With messengers, for example, when we are not sure if the messenger in one scene is the same as the messenger in another, we use .X as a kind of algebraic variable. MESSENGERS.1 cannot be MESSENGERS.2, but MESSENGERS.X might be.</p>          \n",
      "                    <p>When it is impossible to track an individual's entrances and exits, or when it is difficult to know how many characters are in the group, we prefer to track the group rather than individuals. When there is this uncertainty about who in the group is speaking, the .0 modifier is used to single out actions by a subset of the group (one or more individuals). If a single unknown person within the group speaks, that person can be identified with an extra decimal number, e.g. ATTENDANTS.0.1. For example, if a group of ATTENDANTS enters, and one speaks, that one is identified as ATTENDANTS.0.1. If a second, different person speaks that person is ATTENDANTS.0.2. A third speech which may be any of the ATTENDANTS reverts to the wider ATTENDANTS.0 designator.\n",
